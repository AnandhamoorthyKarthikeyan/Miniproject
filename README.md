## Title of the Project
Secure Electronic Health Record (EHR) Management System

## About
The Secure Electronic Health Record Management System is a comprehensive platform designed to digitize and securely manage patient health records. It leverages the MERN stack to offer a responsive, user-friendly interface and robust backend for managing sensitive healthcare data. This system streamlines patient record management, enhances doctor-patient collaboration, and ensures compliance with security and privacy regulations such as HIPAA.

## Features
Role-Based Access Control: Differentiates access levels for administrators, doctors, and patients.
Secure Authentication: Implements JWT (JSON Web Token) for user authentication and encrypted data transfers.
Responsive Design: A colorful and intuitive user interface that works seamlessly on all devices.
Data Audit Trail: Tracks all modifications to health records for accountability.
Patient Dashboard: Patients can view their medical history, prescriptions, and lab reports.
Doctor Tools: Enables doctors to add diagnoses, prescribe medications, and upload test results.
Admin Control Panel: Manages users, reviews audit logs, and oversees system settings.

## Requirements
Operating System: Windows 10 or Ubuntu (64-bit).
Backend Framework: Node.js with Express.js for API development.
Frontend Framework: React.js for building a responsive UI.
Database: MongoDB for secure storage of structured and unstructured health data.
Version Control: Git for collaborative development and efficient code management.
Development Environment: VSCode IDE for coding, debugging, and Git integration.
Security: Encryption standards using bcrypt for passwords and SSL for secure data transfers.

## System Architecture
Frontend: React.js communicates with the backend via REST APIs, providing responsive and dynamic user interactions.
Backend: Node.js with Express.js handles user authentication, data validation, and routing.
Database: MongoDB stores user credentials, medical records, and activity logs in a secure, scalable manner.
Middleware: JWT for session management and bcrypt for hashing passwords.
Deployment: Hosted on a cloud platform like AWS or Heroku, ensuring high availability.
